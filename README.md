# Psychic-Game

# JavaScript Assignment Week 3

### Overview

In this assignment, I chose to create Psychic. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML powered by my JavaScript code.

## Psychic Game (Basic)

1. My app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. I put the following text on my page:

2. Guess what letter I'm thinking of

3. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

4. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

5. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

6. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. I display these until the user either wins or loses.)

7. When the player wins, it will increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

8. When the player loses, it will increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
